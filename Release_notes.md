# Apt Release Notes #

<s>2014 November</s>
_Sometime in 2015_

Inside, a **lot** has changed since I last made an apt release, over 2 years ago. On the surface, not so much! The commands are the same, as are their results. A few bugs have been fixed, and there is more feedback and usage notes throughout, but for the most part people probably won't notice much.

Here are the highlights:

 - **moved development to GitHub**. It's a happenin place in the open source world, and I found myself using it more and more -- not for my own projects necessarily but for others. As I get older I'm less patient with having my pieces scattered every which way, so I'm slowly consolidating in one place, and the GitHub planet has a lot of gravity. (I still wish Mercurial won the mindshare battle over Git, but that's another story.)
